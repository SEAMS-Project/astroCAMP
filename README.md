## 🔍 **What is astroCAMP?**

**astroCAMP (Astronomical Co-design Analysis and Metrics Platform)** is a community-driven framework for evaluating radio-interferometric imaging pipelines under **performance**, **energy**, **scientific quality**, and **sustainability** constraints.

Its goal is to support **hardware–software co-design** for SKA-scale workloads (SKA1-Low and SKA1-Mid) by enabling reproducible, quantitative exploration of:

* system-level behaviour (runtime, energy, throughput),
* platform-level device utilisation (CPU/GPU/FPGA/ASIC),
* algorithmic scientific fidelity (RMS, PSNR, astrometry, photometry, spectra),
* carbon and cost efficiency.

astroCAMP provides **datasets, baseline implementations, standard metrics, and evaluation tools**, allowing fair comparison across heterogeneous architectures and imaging approaches.



# 🎯 **Why astroCAMP?**

The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will operate under **strict power (2–5 MW)** and **cost** envelopes while processing **petascale imaging workloads**.
Most existing imaging benchmarks:

* measure performance **only**,
* neglect scientific fidelity,
* ignore carbon and economic constraints,
* use inconsistent metrics across tools,
* lack reproducibility across HPC systems.

**astroCAMP fills this gap** by introducing a **unified, multi-layer metric suite** and a reproducible **benchmarking protocol** for co-design.



# 🧩 **What’s in this Repository?**

* **Standardised benchmark datasets** for SKA-like workloads
* **Reference output dirty images** for quality comparison
* **A unified suite of performance–quality–sustainability–economic metrics**
* **Baseline imaging pipelines** (e.g., WSClean, IDG)
* **Scripts for power, memory, throughput, and fidelity evaluation**
* **Configuration files** for running controlled experiments
* **Documentation and reproducibility protocol**

# 📐 **Core astroCAMP Co-Design Metrics**

astroCAMP defines **four co-design layers**, each quantifying a different aspect of imaging performance and scientific validity.
All symbols are defined **inline** so the table is fully self-contained.



## **1. System-Level Metrics (End-to-End Execution on Heterogeneous Nodes)**

| ID     | Metric             | Formula           | Unit           | Meaning & Notation                                          |
| ------ | ------------------ | ----------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

| **A3** | Throughput         | `Θ = N / T_c`     | vis/s or img/s | Science processed per second. `N` = visibilities or images. |
| **A4** | Energy efficiency  | `η_E = N / E_c`   | vis/J          | Visibilities per joule.                                     |


## **2. Platform-Level Metrics (CPU / GPU / FPGA / ASIC Devices)**

| ID     | Metric            | Formula                  | Unit | Meaning & Notation                                |

# tools/image_stats/

Helper scripts for inspecting images and residuals, for example:

- quick-look visualisation
- histogram and distribution plots
- simple sanity checks on units and headers

These tools are not part of the benchmark metrics themselves but can be used
to validate that a run produced sensible intermediate products.

# tools/

This directory contains helper tools that support the benchmark, but are not
metrics themselves.

Subfolders:

- `power_measurements/` – scripts for reading hardware power sensors
- `image_stats/` – generic image inspection and plotting tools

These tools are optional but recommended for reproducing the reference
measurement workflow described in the astroCAMP paper and docs.

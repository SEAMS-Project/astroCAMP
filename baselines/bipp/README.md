# baselines/bipp/

Baseline benchmark pipeline using BIPP and related compressed imaging methods.

Suggested contents:

- `run_C1_bipp.sh` – run script for C1 with BIPP
- `configs/` – BIPP-specific configs (e.g. NUFFT settings, compression level)
- `logs/` – example logs and metric outputs

This baseline highlights quality versus efficiency trade-offs when using
approximate or compressed imaging operators.

# baselines/

This directory contains baseline benchmark implementations for commonly used
imaging codes. These serve as:

- reference points in the astroCAMP design space
- examples of how to structure a benchmarkable pipeline

Subfolders:

- `wsclean/` – WSClean-based baseline(s)
- `idg/` – IDG / WS-Snapshot-based baseline(s)
- `bipp/` – BIPP-based baseline(s)

Each subfolder includes configuration files, run scripts, and example metric
outputs for one or more tasks (C1, C2, L1).
